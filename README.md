2. Login to the web interface and open settings.
3. In Settings > Server > Agents select "Gay Adult" and check all required agents.
4. In Settings > Server > Agents move AEBN to last and uncheck Local Media Assets (Movies).
5. Create a new library or change the agent of an existing library to the "Gay Adult" agent, then refresh all metadata.

**View the README inside the studio folders to correctly label your files**

### Please Read
Use site-specific agents if possible, limit search queries (for example, name your movie 3321.mp4 instead of Skater Boys.mp4, it makes it easier on the Agent)

If site-specific agents aren't possible, please use the XML agent.
1. Place video in the setup XML folder
2. Search for metadata
3. Edit XML file in metadata subfolder (XML/metadata/&lt;video&gt;.xml)
